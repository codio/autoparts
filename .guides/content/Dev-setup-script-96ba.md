Box Parts is installed on every Codio Box by default and is installed in the `~/.parts` folder. In order to run Box Parts from the `workspace` folder, which we have just loaded from your forked repo, we need to reconfigure the system slightly.

> **[CLICK HERE](open_terminal bash dev-setup.sh)** to run the reconfiguration script. You only need to do this once.

If you want to see the script, [click here](open_file dev-setup.sh)
