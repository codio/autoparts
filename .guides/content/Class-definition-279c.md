Look at the code in the left panel. The first three lines need to be present in all Parts files. 

```ruby
class MySQL < Package
```

The class definition is the first important line for you to edit. In the example code, `MySQL` is the class name you define. You should choose a name that is unique across all packages.

The package name should use Ruby conventions (CamelCase). This essentially means that the first letter of each word within your class name should be upper case.
